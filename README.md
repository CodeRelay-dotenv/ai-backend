# EduFlow-Nexus - AI Backend ü§ñ  

**Powering Intelligent Campus Solutions with Scalable AI**  

This repository hosts the **AI-driven backend** for EduFlow-Nexus‚Äôs campus life transformation platform. Built on FastAPI, GCP, and Docker, it delivers core functionalities like visual query processing, automated note generation, and video-to-notes conversion to empower students and educators.  

*Deployed on GCP with Docker for scalability. Actively developed during a 30-hour hackathon!*

## üéØ Project Overview  

**Goal**: Build a robust, scalable AI backend to support peer-to-peer learning, accessible education, and seamless academic workflows.  
**Current Focus**: Optimizing AI models for visual queries, chatbots, and real-time audio processing.

## üöÄ Key Features  

### **1. Canvas-Integrated AI Tools**  
- **Visual Query Engine**:  
  - **How It Works**: Analyzes hand-drawn diagrams/images ‚Üí generates code, flowcharts, or explanations (e.g., sketch a graph ‚Üí get Python code for traversal).  
  - **Use Case**: Students/educators quickly convert ideas into executable formats.  
  - **Business Model**: License to universities for STEM labs; premium API access for EdTech firms.  

- **Text-to-Notes Generator**:  
  - **How It Works**: Extracts key concepts from lectures/textbooks ‚Üí creates structured, visual summaries.  
  - **Use Case**: Automate study guides for fast-paced courses.  

### **2. Administrative ChatBot**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Trained on college-specific data (policies, schedules, FAQs) ‚Üí answers queries.  
  - **Use Case**: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the deadline for course registration?‚Äù ‚Üí Instant, accurate response.  
  - **Business Model**: B2B SaaS model ‚Äì colleges pay for customization and support.
    
### **3. Video-to-Notes Pipeline**  
- **How It Works**:  
- **Use Case**: Supports students with disabilities, internships, or language barriers.  
- **Business Model**: Freemium tier for students; institutional subscriptions for bulk access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture  
- **Framework**: FastAPI + Uvicorn.  
- **Deployment**: Dockerized microservices on GCP Compute Engine.  
- **APIs**:  
  - `/generate-content` (POST): Process images ‚Üí return code/diagrams.  
  - `/extract-text` (POST): Fetch answers from college-specific knowledge base.  
  - `/generate-notes` (POST): Async video-to-notes pipeline.

## üöÑ Quick Setup  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/CodeRelay-dotenv/ai-backend.git  
docker-compose up --build  # Requires GCP credentials in ./gcp-credentials
```
